GridBox F1 Backend

This is the Node + Express server for the backend aspect of the GridBox F1 project.
The project uses the Jolpica API (Ergast successor) to find F1 data that is then stored inside a MongoDB database to reduce API calls.

Features : 
- Get Drivers for a specific year
- Get Constructors for a specific year
- Get Season Schedule for a specific year
- Get Grand Prix Circuits for a specific year
- Get Drivers Standings for a specific year
- Get Constructors Standings for a specific year
- Get Race results
- Get Qualifying results
- Get Sprint Race Results
- Create and Retrieve Articles

The project makes use of Prisma as an ORM to abstract and simplify database operations. 
A Redis DB is used as a cache to reduce API response times.
Cloudinary is used to store media and multer + cloudinary's v2 is used to upload provided media to multer.
Helmet is used to add standard security to the server.
CORS is used to block requests from non-whitelisted urls.
